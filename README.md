# LISP
LISP is a functional programming language which was developed by John McCarthy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959. It is one of the second oldest programming languages after FORTRAN but still it is used as it has object oriented programming and high level debugging. It is expression-based. It provides a wide range of data types like arrays, lists, objects, hashtables, etc.
